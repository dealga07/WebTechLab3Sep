        The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders,
         margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages.
          It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements.
           The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.
